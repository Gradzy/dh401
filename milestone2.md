# Data gathering and preprocessing
The requirement for this milestone is an Jupyter notebook* in which you present the data that you will be using for your project. It is not the exploratory analysis of the full data set, which is milestone 3. Rather, the idea is to prove--based on milestone 1 and on the feedback that you have received for it--a deepened reflection on your project goal (section 1) and to present technical details (sections 2 & 3). Submit your notebook to your git repository in a form, that all outputs are present, i.e. that we don't have to rerun the notebook.

* Depending on the tools you use, you can also provide some other notebook format. In this case, make sure that we can read this format by converting it to PDF/HTML/Markdown.

# 1. Narrowing down the research question
As discussed in the feedback session, your research question needs to be pinned down to one or several concrete and attainable goals. In the first section of the notebook please address the following points:

- Name your concrete questions and explain them briefly.
- Analyse how these questions relate to your original idea, that is, in what way they narrow it down.
- Describe the dataset you selected and the information represented in it.
- Discuss how the data enables you to answer your questions.
- Formulate educated guesses on your outcomes based on this data.
- Reason on how you can tell in the end whether these outcomes have manifested or not and how confident you will possibly be.

There is no point in answering to these points one after another. Rather, your grade will partly be based on how well the structure of your text reveals and supports your reflection. (Hint: A good advice could be to draft concrete answers to every point and to then look at the full picture in order to design a compelling argumentative structure. Think about how a hypothetical reader can understand the text without already knowing what you want to say.)

# 2. Gathering the data
The other two sections are more technical. Here you can show that you understand your data and know how to use it. You can be brief in your answers. Section 2 may be supported with (an) informative plot(s).

- Where do you get your data from?
- How do you get it?
- What is the maximum available amount in theory (in the case of incomplete data aquisition)?
- How much can you actually hope to lay hand on for milestone 3 on April 20th?

# 3. Data format
This section is the main reason why this milestone is to be delivered in a Jupyter notebook: Give insightful examples for every question by loading and transforming data samples.

- What format(s) does the raw data come in?
- How is the information that the dataset represents encoded in this format?
- Load your dataset and show examples of how you access the information that you are interested in. 
- Give an overview of your dataset by plotting some basic statistics of the relevant features and/or metadata.
